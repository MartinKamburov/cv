            <p><em>Attending Carleton University pursuing a Bachelors in Computer Science Game Development Stream</em></p>
            <p> I am currently in my second year of studies at Carleton University pursuing
                a Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science focused on Game Development. I heard about the position of a
                coding instructor through indeed. As a Computer Science student with an avid passion for learning coding
                principles, I have had experience programming in Python, Java, and C, and have gained exceptional
                knowledge in several essential coding principles. I have also developed the relevant skills that would highly
                benefit in a team setting and as an instructor such as actively motivating a team, and the ability to
                communicate clearly, respectfully, and constructively. I am always enthusiastic, and constantly carry an
                insatiable appetite to learn and grow.
